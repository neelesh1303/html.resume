    <h2>Summary: </h2>
    <p>I am Neelesh Kumar Tripathi, a student at The National Institute of Engineering, currently on a journey to strengthen my technical skills and expand my knowledge in the field of computer science. My learning path is focused on both web development and programming fundamentals, enabling me to build a strong foundation for future projects and problem-solving challenges.</p>

        <p>I am actively learning HTML and CSS, which are essential for front-end web development. These technologies allow me to create structured, visually appealing, and responsive web pages. As I progress, I aim to explore more advanced topics in web development, including JavaScript and modern frameworks.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to web development, I am also diving into programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java. Each of these languages plays a crucial role in my learning process. C and C++ provide me with a deep understanding of memory management and system-level programming, while Python helps me grasp scripting, automation, and problem-solving with ease. Meanwhile, Java introduces me to object-oriented programming and is widely used in application development. </p>
        
        <p>Currently, I am also focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to improve my logical thinking and coding efficiency. Understanding DSA is crucial for writing optimized code and excelling in competitive programming, technical interviews, and real-world problem-solving. My goal is to master key concepts such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming to develop efficient solutions.</p>
        
        <p>As I continue my learning journey, I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world projects, participate in coding challenges, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. With dedication and continuous practice, I strive to enhance my skills and prepare myself for future opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
